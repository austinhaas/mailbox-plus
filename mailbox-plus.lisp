an integer specifying the amount of time to wait (in milliseconds). A
negative timeout value is the same as 0. A
mailbox-plus-timeout-condition is signaled if a message is not
received before timeout.

Two restarts are provided, allowing the operation to continue waiting:

continue-waiting: takes 0 arguments and causes the operation to wait
another timeout milliseconds

continue-waiting-with-new-timeout: takes 1 arguments: a new value for
timeout"
